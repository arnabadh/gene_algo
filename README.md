A generalized binary coded genetic algorithm has been written and validated by me using some multivariate objective function in the literature. The algorithm meu+lamda 
strategy has been employed by me along with a binary tournament selection,single point crossover and global mutation to achieve the optimum solution. 
In addition, I constructed the same code in an alternative way, using elitism instead of the meu+lambda technique to cut computational cost and arrive at optimum 
solution.
