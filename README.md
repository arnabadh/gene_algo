# gene_algo
A generalized binary coded genetic algorithm (BGA_meu_lambda.ipynb) has been written in python and validated by me using some multivariate objective function in the literature. The meu+lamda strategy has been employed by me along with a binary tournament selection,single point crossover and global mutation to achieve the optimum solution. In addition, I constructed the same code in an alternative way (BGA_elitism.ipynb), using elitism instead of the meu+lambda technique to cut computational cost and arrive at optimum 
solution.
